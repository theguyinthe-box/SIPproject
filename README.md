Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is characterized by an intense preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws, often leading to significant distress and a tendency for individuals to focus on specific details rather than the overall image (1). 
The widespread use of photo editing tools and social media has contributed to the proliferation of idealized beauty standards, which in turn has been linked to increased body image dissatisfaction within the general population (2,3). 
There is a critical need to understand how digital alterations of self-images influence perception, especially for individuals predisposed to body image concerns (4). 
Our study utilizes AI-assisted facial manipulation. This approach allows for the creation of ecologically valid and psychologically relevant changes to facial attributes such as smile, attractiveness, hair, age, lips, nose, and weight. 
The ability to generate subtle to moderate alterations across these eight categories is crucial for exploring detection thresholds and ensuring that manipulations are plausible without being overly distressing. 
This methodology offers a novel way to investigate how individuals perceive alterations to their self-image, moving beyond traditional methods by employing advanced AI technology to simulate real-world digital enhancements.
A key aspect of this research involves correlating detection accuracy of manipulated self-images with Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) scores (5). 
Prior research suggests a positive correlation between photo manipulation and body image dissatisfaction, indicating that individuals with higher body image concerns may exhibit different perceptual abilities (6,7). 
By examining this relationship, our study aims to provide novel insights into the perceptual biases and cognitive mechanisms underlying BDD symptoms, contributing significantly to our understanding of self-image perception in the digital age.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between self-image perception and AI-assisted digital manipulation, building upon existing literature concerning Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and the impact of digital image manipulation.
Participants will have a standardized facial photograph taken under controlled lighting and camera conditions. 
Using a neural network, researchers will generate five subtle-to-moderate manipulated variants per image across seven different attributes (smile, attractiveness, hair, age, lips, nose, and weight). 
Participants will be asked to complete a survey consisting of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire and general demographic information including age and gender. 
Participants will then complete an image recognition task in which they must identify whether each of 40 images is the “original” or “altered” version.
Accuracy rates for identifying manipulated images will be correlated with participants’ Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) scores. 
Additional analyses will control for gender and age as covariates. 
Data will be analyzed using within-subjects comparisons and regression models to assess the relationship between BDD-related symptoms and perceptual sensitivity to alterations in self-image.
Findings may contribute to understanding cognitive and perceptual mechanisms underlying self-image evaluation and BDD. 
The study could inform clinical interventions and public awareness about the psychological effects of digital self-representation and manipulation.

Participants will receive full informed consent detailing the nature of image manipulations and their right to withdraw at any time. 
After completion, all participants will be debriefed, reassured of their actual appearance, and provided with resources for mental health support. 
Participants will receive a Subject ID number upon signing a consent form. 
Subjects will complete the image recognition task and all locally stored images will be deleted upon exiting the program to ensure privacy and confidentiality.
